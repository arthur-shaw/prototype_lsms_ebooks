<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Chapter 4: Agricultural Inputs</h1>
<p>The production function approach to questionnaire design requires mapping inputs to the outputs produced at plot level. This chapter reviews the measurement of chemical and organic inputs, agricultural labor and agricultural capital allocated to the plot including farm implements and machinery. The primary measurement challenge in designing an agricultural questionnaire to capture seasonal plot level production is precisely the attribution of inputs to the plot. Agricultural labor is drawn from the household’s members, exchange labor, or hired labor from the community. In the case of exchange and hired labor, recall at the plot level may be facilitated by supervision requirements, the timing of the labor demand during the production process (planting, harvest, etc.) and the relative infrequency of these types of labor on plots. Household agricultural labor recall may suffer from attribution of household labor across multiple plots and over relatively longer recall periods. These measurement challenges are closely related to general challenges in time use modules. Fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides are normally purchased in bulk and distributed across the household or farmer’s plots. Measuring machinery or farm implement use at the plot-level is related to the attribution challenge of non-labor inputs. Machinery and farm implements are capital goods that are used over multiple agricultural seasons. Quantifying how much they are used on a particular plot and the associated cost depends on the type of machinery and agricultural production process.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Agricultural labor</h2>
<p>A large body of literature is devoted to agricultural labor measurement to understand national employment, labor productivity and worker earnings. The primary motivation for agricultural labor measurement is to better understand smallholder agricultural productivity and its determinants. One of the most important of these determinants being is labor for which poor households have relatively larger endowments compared to capital or other inputs. Researchers and survey practitioners interested in measuring participation rates in work and employment are encouraged to consult the 19<sup>th</sup> International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) standards and the pilot studies conducted by the International Labour Organization related to the measurement of those concepts (Benes and Walsh, 2018a, 2018b). The focus in this section is exclusively on agricultural labor conducted on the household farm, including that by household members and hired and exchange laborers.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Sagesaka et al. (2019) summarizes much of the current literature on measuring work in agricultural household surveys. Dixon-Mueller and Anker (1988) highlight how the classification of workers based on their main activity leads to underestimating the number of economically active women, primarily because women contribute significantly to both household and agricultural work. A significant number of survey experiments have also addressed survey design issues in agricultural labor measurement. A key set of survey design choices in agricultural labor measurement have been how to frame questions regarding farm work and whether labor information needs to be self-reported or permissive of proxy response. Bardasi et al. (2011) estimate biases in labor force participation, hours worked and income by gender and sector of employment due to questionnaire design such as screening questions and proxy response. In their survey experiment from Tanzania, they find no difference in female labor statistics due to proxy response, but lower male employment rates due to underreporting agricultural activity by proxy respondents. In Malawi, Kilic et al. (2020) find that proxy reporting increases underreporting of employment when recall periods increase and when women are the subject of proxy reporting. Arthi et al. (2018) estimate the effects of recall period, either weekly agricultural labor reporting or end of the season reporting. End of season recall increases by four times the hours reported by individuals at the plot level relative to those reporting weekly. They note aggregation to household level reporting causes the reported hour differences between the weekly and end of season recall periods to disappear. Arthi et al. (2018) interpret these findings as evidence that recall bias is driven by mental burdens of reporting such disaggregated time use patterns as well as memory. Given that these biases may differ depending on the level of aggregation at which they are used, the Tanzanian experiment suggest that agricultural labor productivity would be understated which are similar to findings by Gaddis et al. (2019) in Ghana.</p>
<p>Given the difficulties of measuring labor productivity, due to attributing output to a particular worker and the unit of time in which they produced such output, Akogun et al. (2020) measure the physical activity of sugarcane cutters which is a direct measure of effort in their piece rate wage setting. They find a high correlation between administrative data on output per worker recorded by the firm and the worker’s physical activity, as well as large changes in the intensity of such activity in response to malaria testing and treatment. Integrating physical activity measures into national surveys may be possible using a subsample to calibrate biases in reported time use as well as predict effort-based measures of agricultural labor productivity.</p>
<p>An often overlooked agricultural labor measurement issue is the classification of children’s time in agriculture. The ILO’s International Conference of Labour Statisticians in 2008 focused on child labor measurement methodology and statistics. ILO (2008 and 2017) summarizes many of the measurement issues related to the classification of children’s time in agriculture as work, child labor, or hazardous work. Definitions of child labor and hazardous work depend on the country legal and agricultural production context, despite efforts to standardize official reporting of child labor statistics. Guarcello et al. (2008) review 87 datasets from 35 countries that collect information on child labor. They conclude variation in child labor statistics varies more broadly within and across surveys relative to other children’s activities such as schooling. While variation such as questionnaire design and sampling do explain some of this variation, Guarcello et al. (2008) note the importance of interviewer training and social stigma as potentially influential factors that may also create variation in reported child labor information.</p>
<p>Dillon et al. (2012) extend the analysis from Bardasi et al. (2011) in the context of child labor statistics and survey design, finding that in rural Tanzania proxy reporting from adults did not reduce child labor reporting relative to children’s own self-reports. Rather, classification using less precise questions regarding work activities that should be classified as labor force participation reduced by 16 percentage points girl and boy reported participation in agriculture in comparison to survey designs that included screening questions listing specific work activities. The Tanzanian results are somewhat surprising in that the presumption of the international community is often that parents will want to avoid reporting child labor. However, in rural communities such as those in Tanzania, child work in agriculture is not uncommon and social stigma is low as children’s work is viewed as human capital building. Careful training of interviewers to be mindful of cultural context may help improve reporting on (presumed) sensitive topics.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Seed, fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides</h2>
<p>Measuring seed acquisition in input modules requires a questionnaire design that differs from recording other non-labor agricultural inputs. This is primarily due to the common informality of seed exchange among rural producers, but even in more formal seed markets, significant differences in seed brand names and seed traits lead to potential misclassification. For some empirical applications, the researcher may want to link seed brand names to consumer choices. In many seed applications, the researcher may be interested in the complementary nature of seed choice and other input choices, or the return to specific seed traits such as drought tolerance or germination speed, in which case, the seed trait is the relevant seed characteristic. These classification issues, identifying both brand and traits of a specific input, are not exclusive to seeds. In the case of fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides, brand names are not directly aligned to chemical compositions of the input. Fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide packaging lists the chemical composition of the product which can be used to identify product traits along with the brand name. Non-standard unit reporting and planting technique or application method are also important non-labor agricultural input measurement issues. We have discussed non-standard units of reporting in the previous chapter. We note Oseni et al. (2017) provides extensive discussion of measurement techniques for non-standard units. We also highlight that planting techniques and application methods are critical to understand as complementary to the traits of the non-agricultural inputs that agronomically will affect the returns to these inputs. Planting and land-management choices such as micro-dosing, distance between crops, mounding or bunding, or inter-cropping will change the potential yield of seeds. Mixing techniques for herbicides and pesticides, as well as application methods affect chemical absorption. Similarly, fertilizer application methods such as broadcasting and micro-dosing will affect the return to these inputs.</p>
<p>An objective of measuring input use is to understand the returns to different agricultural investments, hence measuring the often-unobservable quality of inputs is an important characteristic of input investments. With many products, quality is not completely observable and quality perceptions matter. This holds true for seeds and other non-labor inputs. Improved seed varieties have been shown to produce greater, more resistance yields. However, due to several factors including seed recycling practices, informal or unregulated seed markets, counterfeit seed, and asymmetric information, among others, farmers are often uninformed or misinformed of the true variety they are cultivating. Given the numerous stages of the seed supply chain in which variety can be masked or modified, it is not surprising that farmer knowledge of seed variety is generally limited. Farmer identification of simply the type of seed, whether improved or local seed rather than the specific variety, is still challenging. Wineman et al. (2020) find, from a methodological study comparing farmer seed type identification against DNA fingerprinting, that farmers in Tanzania correctly identified maize seed type (improved or local) 70 percent of the time. Similarly, research in Ethiopia on the ability of farmers to identify the type and variety of sweet potato found that 20 percent of farmers falsely reported local varieties as improved, and 19 percent falsely reported improved varieties as local (Kosmowski et al., 2018). With respect to the quality of other inputs, Ashour et al. (2019) find that farmer’s perceptions of herbicide quality are overstated, but that product quality is adulterated in their sample. Fifteen percent of the herbicide samples they test are missing the active ingredient, while farmers believe that 41 percent of herbicides are counterfeit in their sample. Michaelson et al. (2018) report on farmer perceptions of input quality, comparing farmer perceptions with nutrient quality from laboratory-based measures. They find that in their sample from Tanzania fertilizers purchased in the market were not adulterated, yet farmers believed that they had been based on observable characteristics of the fertilizer sample which are not necessarily correlated with nutrient quality.</p>

<div id="machinery-and-farm-implements" class="section level2" number="4.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Machinery and Farm Implements</h2>
<p>Agricultural capital in the form of machinery and farm implements can increase the productivity of smallholder farmers. Understanding how farm size and profitability change over time are linked to the mechanization of agriculture. While it is generally regarded as easy for farmers to recall agricultural capital within the household, the plot-level attribution and control of such capital are measurement challenges. Plot level attribution of machinery use is often avoided as it may be assumed by the survey designer that agricultural capital is shared equally in the household.</p>
<p>A large literature on women’s empowerment in agriculture has focused on the correct measurement between women and men’s ownership of assets versus their use-rights. Alkire et al. (2013) and Doss and Kieran (2014) provide a comprehensive review and guidelines for collecting sex-disaggregated asset data which apply generally to agricultural capital modules. They emphasize the importance of respondent and the method of collecting ownership and use-rights. Data from the machinery and farm implements modules can be linked to plot disaggregated production and other inputs modules to assess differences in intrahousehold allocation of inputs (Udry, 1996).</p>
<p>Recall periods for agricultural machinery and implements usually focuses on the availability of assets over the previous 12 months, differences in input use by crop-plot-season are important to capture, but may not be possible if the frequency of survey administration is annually, rather than seasonally. Machine age is usually collected with the intention that depreciation might be calculated, but much machinery depreciation depends on use frequency and maintenance which are more difficult to capture in household surveys.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Agricultural Inputs: Design Features of the Reference Questionnaires</h2>
<p>Input utilization is captured in both the post-planting and post-harvest questionnaires. In the post-planting questionnaire, labor used for land clearing and planting is recorded in module 5 as well as seed acquisition in module 7. In the post-harvest questionnaire, input use, labor inputs including household, hired and exchange labor, farm capital, and extension service use is documented in modules 2-5 and 11-13.</p>
<p>Labor in the post-planting questionnaire relates specifically to land preparation, planting, weeding, ridging or fertilizing, and supervision labor. Labor inputs are recorded at the parcel-plot-individual level in the household labor input module 5A. The number of days and the average number of hours provided on the plot are registered. In module 5B, hired and exchange labor is recorded at the parcel-plot by person type (for instance men, women, and children under 15). The number of person types used on the parcel-plot, the days, the hours per day, activities and remuneration are documented. With respect to remuneration, the value of payments including those in-kind are asked. Exchange labor is also recorded at the parcel-plot level, but no estimation of remuneration is documented, only the number of person types, days, hours per day and activities are included in the post-planting labor modules. This survey design feature captures local context of reciprocal labor markets but makes calculating agricultural wages challenging due to the sampling of households which may have low labor demand. Alternative labor market surveys or supplemental agricultural labor market modules may be essential to accurately capture agricultural wage variation.</p>
<p>Information on seed acquisition is found in module 7 of the post-planting questionnaire. Seed acquisition information is linked to the crop codes, rather than alternative units of analysis such as the parcel-plot. As a survey design choice, collecting seed information at the plot level may be overly repetitive for the respondent, but the seed acquisition module does allow for multiple seed types to be recorded per crop. In this module, the source of seed acquisition is the organizing principle of the module. Seed can be left over from a previous harvest, acquired freely or purchased.</p>
<p>In the post-harvest questionnaire, input use related to production after planting is collected. Organic and inorganic fertilizer use, herbicide/pesticides use, and any equipment or machinery used for harvesting are populated in the input roster collected at the parcel-plot level in post-harvest questionnaire module 3. The input roster, module 4, is organized by input type and documents input purchases, quantities, and who financed inputs. Input acquisition such as being left over from the previous season, own-produced inputs or free inputs are included in accounting for quantities obtained by the household.</p>
<p>Labor during the harvest period is documented in module 5A for household labor and module 5B for hired and exchange labor. The questionnaire modules are similar to those of the post-planting labor module though post-harvest activities such as threshing/shelling and cleaning are expressly not recorded, so that this information can be collected within the post-harvest labor modules found in modules 12A (household) and 12B (hired/exchange labor). These post-harvest labor modules relate to agricultural labor activities such as threshing/shelling, drying, cleaning, and processing.</p>
<p>The last input-related modules in the post-harvest questionnaire include the agricultural capital and extension services modules (13 and 14, respectively). The agricultural capital module captures farm implements, machinery and structures that are inputs into agricultural production. The unit of analysis in this module is that of the item. The number, age, and sale value of the item is recorded. Any rental costs or rental revenues from such items are also recorded in the questionnaire to facilitate cost analysis of production. The extension services module documents information received, who received information, and the frequency of contact with an extensive list of agricultural extension sources. These include both formal sources such as government, NGO, private extension agents, or cooperatives, but also from peer farmers and media sources.</p>
