[^2]: The gold standard approach of individual, self-respondent interviews for the measurement of asset ownership and control in household surveys has been recently researched and supported by the United Nations Statistical Commission through the United Nations Evidence for Gender Equality (EDGE) Initiative. The EDGE Initiative led to the publication of the United Nations Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Asset Ownership from a Gender Perspective (UNSD, 2019).

[^4]: Standard GPS devices have reported position accuracy of approximately ten meters depending on the model's satellite calibration algorithm (http://www8.garmin.com/aboutGPS/). GPS receivers using WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) can have accuracy of three meters by correcting for atmospheric conditions.

[^5]: In addition to land use information, Donaldson and Storeygard (2016) note remote sensing data sources available to produce data related to mineral deposits, elevation, terrain, and land cover, as well as airborne pollution, fish abundance and electricity use.

[^6]: Sch√∏ning et al. (2005) find a statistically significant difference for plots under 0.5 hectares but not for plots equal to or greater than 0.5 hectares. Keita and Carfagna (2009) separate their sample into five clusters based on plot size. They find a statistically significant difference for the clusters with the lowest land size but not for the clusters with larger plots. However, they do not specify the plot size range for each cluster.
